# Hi. I'm Heath.
> *"Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value." - Albert Einstein*

I've been a k12 Iowa educator for the past 11 years.  Currently I teach 5-8 technology classes at [Decorah Community Schools](http://www.decorah.k12.ia.us/).  I have always enjoyed technology, but in the last year I decided to invest more in training to improve my skills.  I am a graduate student in the educational technology program at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/education-edtech/).  I also recently enrolled in the [DeltaV Coding School](https://www.deltavcodeschool.com/). In my free time I like to spend time with my family and friends, do woodworking projects, and drink coffee on my front porch.
