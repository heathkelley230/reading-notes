# Making Websites Interactive

## What is Javascript? 
While HTML provides the structure of a page and CSS styles the webpage, Javascript makes the website interactive.  Websites are rarely static anymore and have many interactive content.  Therefore, it is important for front-end web developers to understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  

## Setting Up a Javascript File
Create a new javascript file that has a .jss extension. Link the javascript file into the document.  It can go anywhere but is usually at the bottom inside the body tag.  Be sure the file is linked correctly.

## Important Ideas/Terms to Know When Getting Started With JS
Javascript is a text-based programming language that is object oriented.  The objects in Javascript contain values that can be accessed in order to perform certain functions.  Before understanding more about js, there are a few key ideas and terms that are important to know:
- Statement: Each instruction within js code is written as a statement.  Statements in js are separated by semicolons (;).
- JS comments can explain what the code does.  Use // [comment] for comments on a single line statement or /* [insert comment] */ for longer, multi-line comments.
- Variable: This is where information is stored within js.  Variables change depending on the specific data input.  A variable uses the keyword var followed by a variable name, assignment operator (=) and value.  Example: var name='firstlast';
- Variables can store data types such as numbers, strings (letters and characters), or Boolean data (true/false).
- Variables have specific naming rules.
