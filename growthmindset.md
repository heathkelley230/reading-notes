# What is Growth Mindset?
> *Love Challenges. Be intrigued by mistakes. Enjoy effort and keep on learning. -Carol Dweck*

A person can learn just about anything with the right patience and determination. The neuroscience confirms the fact that a person's brain is physically wired to connect more neurons as more learning takes place. If a person is learning something (like coding!) for the first time, the connections in the brain fire faster with more repetition. The neurons form bridges that are stronger with each move.  A person can apply the concept of growth mindset to any facet of our lives. The concept of growth mindset should inspire onself to do anything they put their mind to.

One of the key aspects of growth mindset is the fact that we learn from our mistakes.  Here is a [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLYECIjmnQs) that illustrates this idea.  

Here are a few more motivational quotes that help me think about growth mindset:
- *Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. - Albert Einstein*
- *If you are are absent in the struggle don't expect to be present in the success. - Will Smith*
- *Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I feel down and got back up again. -Nelson Mendela*
