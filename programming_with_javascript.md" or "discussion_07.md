### What Is A Script and How Do You Create One?
A script is a series of instructions like a recipe, handbook, or manual.  Scripts are steps that the computer follows, and the scripts can respond to user input.  

Writing a script starts with beginning with the end in mind.  The user should:
- Define the goal
- Design the script
- Code each individual step in a way the computer understands (e.g., coding language)  

Each individual task must be broken down into a sequence of steps. Flowcharts can be used to help visually display each step of the process.

### The Basics of Expressions and Operators 
Expressions may simply assign a value to a variable (e.g., var height = 6) or perform an operation such as var speed = 10 / 2. Expressions rely on operators.  Operators can change values, perform mathemematical equations, concatenate strings, and other functions based on logic. Here are a few names and purposes of operators:
- Arithmetic Operator: Performs mathematical equations using code such as +, -, *, etc.
- Assigment Operator: Assigns a value to a variable (e.g., width = 24;) 
- String Operator: The string operators (+) joins strings together.  Note:  You cannot mix a number and a string together.  If you try to do this, the number simply becomes part of the string.  The process of joining two or more strings together is called **concatenation**.
