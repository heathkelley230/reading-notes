# Simple Customization Through Markdown

## Why Not Use a Word Processor?
When a person uses Microsoft Word or Google Docs, what they type into the text editor becomes the same text displayed on the webpage. However, in order for a webpage to be read by a browser it reads a markup language (the most popular being HTML). These word processing applications take care of the HTML formatting that happens behind the scenes in the code. A person does not have to add any tags or other coding to ensure the output on the webpage is structured and styled as they want it - the word processor does the work. 

So why not stick to a word processor? The answer lies in the ability to **customize**. While word processors can be effective for certain projects, there is a lack of customization that occurs. Examples of customization through coding might include adding grids, navigation, or changing colors and styles.  

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a ***markup*** language that makes it easy to structure and style a webpage. Markdown enables easy customization by using a simple syntax (See [Basic Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)). Markdown enables a coder to quickly read and write the changes they are making without applying other code (such as HTML tags).  Markdown also allows inline html formatting ([see link](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html)).
